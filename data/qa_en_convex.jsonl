    "question": "What is a Carbon Credit?",
    "answer": "A carbon credit is a certificate or permit representing the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide (CO₂) or the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse gas. Each credit also signifies that one ton of CO₂ has been successfully avoided, reduced, or removed from the atmosphere by a specific project.\nEssentially, a carbon credit is a tradable commodity that can be bought and sold on the carbon market. Businesses that generate credits through emission-reduction projects can sell them for additional revenue, while businesses that need to offset their own emissions can purchase them to meet their goals.",

    "question": "What are Compliance and Voluntary Carbon Markets?",
    "answer": "## Compliance Carbon Market\nThe compliance carbon market is established and operated based on national or international agreements and legally binding commitments to reduce carbon emissions. Key examples include the Kyoto Protocol (which required developed countries to reduce average greenhouse gas emissions by at least 5% below 1990 levels during the 2008-2012 period) and Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.\nA common model for the compliance market is the Emission Trading System (ETS), also known as \"cap-and-trade.\" Under this mechanism, a government sets a cap on total emissions and then allocates or sells a limited number of emission allowances to regulated entities. These entities are only permitted to emit up to the amount of allowances they hold. If a company needs to emit more than its allocation, it must purchase additional allowances from other organizations that have a surplus.\nThis system creates a financial cost for emitting, incentivizing companies to reduce their greenhouse gas output and invest in cleaner, more environmentally friendly technologies.\n## Voluntary Carbon Market\nThe voluntary carbon market operates in parallel to the compliance market. It allows corporations, organizations, and individuals to purchase carbon credits on a voluntary basis to offset their emissions, often as part of corporate social responsibility (CSR) or Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategies. Participation is not mandated by law.\n| Criteria | Voluntary Market (VCM) | Compliance Market |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Purpose | To meet voluntary climate goals, enhance brand image, and fulfill ESG commitments. | To comply with legally binding emission reduction targets and avoid penalties. |\n| Participants | Businesses, organizations, and individuals are participating voluntarily. | Major emitting sectors mandated by the government (e.g., power, industry). |\n| Legal Framework | Non-mandatory; based on independent international standards (e.g., Verra's VCS, Gold Standard). | Strict, with clear government regulations, monitoring, and oversight. |\n| Credit Price | Flexible; varies by project type, quality, location, and co-benefits. | Typically higher; fluctuates based on the supply and demand of allowances. |\n| Liquidity | Historically lower, but growing rapidly. | Higher and more stable due to regulated demand. |\n| Scale & Potential | Smaller in value but fast-growing with significant potential for expansion. | Large and established, concentrated in regions with cap-and-trade policies. |\n| Risks | Lack of transparency, inconsistent credit quality, and potential for greenwashing. | Dependence on government policy changes, high compliance costs, and price volatility. |\n***Table 1:*** *Comparison Table between the Voluntary Carbon Market and the Compliance Carbon Market[[1]](#footnote-0)*\n#",

    "question": "Vietnamese legal documents related to the carbon market",
    "answer": "To achieve its commitment of reaching Net Zero emissions by 2050, Vietnam has been progressively building a comprehensive legal framework to govern its domestic carbon market. The development of this framework can be understood through three distinct phases: the establishment of foundational policies, the issuance of detailed implementation regulations, and the creation of sector-specific guidance.\n## Foundational policies and Strategic orientations\nThe groundwork for Vietnam's carbon market was laid by several key strategic documents:\n| Resolution No. 24-NQ/TW (2013)[[6]](#footnote-5) | This resolution from the Party Central Committee was a landmark document that identified greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation and the development of a carbon market as national priorities, signaling high-level political commitment. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Plan for Implementation of the Paris Agreement (2016) | Following its ratification of the Paris Agreement, Vietnam issued this plan to translate its international commitments into domestic tasks. It explicitly included the mandate to develop mechanisms for managing and trading carbon credits, setting the stage for future market participation. |\n| Law on Forestry (2017)[[7]](#footnote-6) | This law provided the first legal basis for commodifying forest-based climate action by officially recognizing the \"carbon absorption and sequestration services of forests.\" This opened the door for developing projects to trade forest carbon credits. |\n| Law on Environmental Protection (2020)[[8]](#footnote-7) | This is the most critical piece of foundational legislation, as Article 139 is dedicated entirely to the \"Organization and development of the carbon market.\" The law officially mandated the creation of a domestic carbon market and established a clear roadmap for its development, covering both emissions allowance trading and carbon credit offsetting. |\n## Detailed Regulations and Implementation Roadmap\nBuilding on the foundation of the 2020 Law on Environmental Protection, the government issued a series of decrees and decisions to detail the operational rules of the market:\n| Decree 06/2022/NĐ-CP[[9]](#footnote-8) | This is the cornerstone regulation that provides detailed guidance on GHG mitigation. It established the official roadmap for the carbon market, scheduling a pilot phase from 2025 and full operation from 2028. The decree outlines the responsibilities for facilities required to conduct GHG inventories, sets the principles for allocating emissions allowances, and establishes the rules for using carbon credits to offset excess emissions (capped at 10% of a facility's total allowance). |\n| --- | --- |\n| Decision No. 01/2022/QĐ-TTg[[10]](#footnote-9) | This decision identified the entities that are legally obligated to participate in the GHG inventory and reporting system, listing 1,912 facilities across the energy, transportation, construction, industrial processes, and agriculture sectors. |\n| Decision No. 232/QĐ-TTg (2025)[[11]](#footnote-10) | This decision approved the official \"Scheme for the Development of a Carbon Market in Vietnam,\" reaffirming the national roadmap.

    "question": "How does the voluntary carbon market differ from the pilot Emission Trading System (ETS) in Vietnam?",
    "answer": "As Vietnam prepares to launch its pilot Emission Trading System (ETS), it is important to understand how this new compliance market will differ from the existing Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM). While both involve the trading of environmental assets, they operate on fundamentally different principles and serve distinct purposes. The VCM is driven by voluntary corporate climate goals, whereas the ETS is a regulatory tool designed to enforce national emission reduction targets.[[19]](#footnote-18)\nHere is a detailed comparison of the two systems:\n| Criteria | Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) | Vietnam's Pilot Emission Trading System (ETS) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Nature & Purpose | Voluntary. Participants choose to buy credits to offset their emissions for ESG, CSR, or brand reputation purposes. | Mandatory. A \"cap-and-trade\" system where the government sets a limit (cap) on total emissions and participants must comply. |\n| Participants | Any organization, corporation, or individual can choose to participate. | Mandatory for large emitting facilities designated by the government, initially focusing on key sectors like steel, cement, and thermal power.[[20]](#footnote-19) |\n| Tradable Unit | Carbon Credits.

    "question": "How do carbon credits and emission quotas differ?",
    "answer": "Although both are key instruments in carbon markets and represent the \"right to emit\" one ton of CO₂ equivalent, emission quotas and carbon credits originate and function in fundamentally different ways. Understanding this distinction is critical to understanding how a compliance market like Vietnam's ETS operates.[[23]](#footnote-22)\nAn emission quota, often called an allowance, is the legal right for a nation, organization, or individual to emit a specific amount of greenhouse gas within a defined period, as defined in Vietnam's Law on Environmental Protection 2020. Quotas are the core component of a \"cap-and-trade\" or Emission Trading System (ETS). In this top-down system, the government first sets an overall emissions limit (the cap) for specific industries and then allocates these quotas to regulated facilities. Each facility must hold and surrender a number of quotas equal to its total emissions for that period. If a facility emits less than its allocation, it can sell its surplus quotas; if it emits more, it must purchase additional quotas from the market.\nA carbon credit, by contrast, represents the avoidance, reduction, or removal of one ton of CO₂e from the atmosphere. Unlike quotas, which are allocated by a government, carbon credits are generated from specific, voluntary projects (e.g., a renewable energy plant, a reforestation initiative). These projects must undergo a rigorous Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) process under a recognized standard (like the VCS or Gold Standard) to prove their climate impact. Once verified, the emission reductions are issued as tradable credits. These can then be purchased by companies to voluntarily offset their emissions or, as permitted under an ETS, to meet a portion of their compliance obligations.\n| Criteria | Emission Quota (Allowance) | Carbon Credit (Offset) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Origin | Created and allocated by a government under a regulatory cap (\"top-down\"). | Generated by a specific project that proves it has reduced or removed emissions (\"bottom-up\"). |\n| Primary Function | A permit to emit.

This includes legacy credits from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and, significantly, credits from bilateral partnerships like the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) between Vietnam and Japan.[[24]](#footnote-23)\nBy allowing for this diverse range of credit types, Vietnam is positioning its market to be flexible and capable of seamlessly integrating with both regional and global carbon trading systems.",

    "question": "If an enterprise exceeds the permitted emission level in the ETS, how will it be handled?",
    "answer": "The primary mechanism for handling emissions that exceed a facility's initial allocation is through market participation. Under the ETS, any regulated enterprise is required to surrender a quantity of emission allowances equal to its total verified emissions for a given compliance period. If a company's emissions exceed its allocated quota, it must acquire the necessary number of additional allowances by purchasing them from the carbon market.\nRegarding penalties for non-compliance, Vietnam's legal framework is still under development. While Decree No. 45/2022/ND-CP is the primary legal document for sanctioning administrative violations in environmental protection, its current provisions do not yet specify penalties for the act of exceeding emission quotas.[[25]](#footnote-24) Instead, Article 41 of this Decree focuses on violations related to the preparatory obligations for the carbon market, such as failing to conduct a greenhouse gas inventory or not adhering to reporting requirements.\nIt is anticipated that specific regulations detailing the financial penalties and enforcement actions for failing to surrender the required number of allowances will be issued as the ETS moves closer to its official operational launch in 2028.",

    "question": "How does an SME calculate its total greenhouse gas emissions (carbon footprint)?",
    "answer": "To navigate emerging regulations like the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and participate effectively in the carbon market, the first essential step for any enterprise is to establish a comprehensive Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory. This process, often called calculating a corporate carbon footprint, provides the foundational data for all climate-related action.\nIn Vietnam, the calculation of facility-level GHG emissions is guided by Decree No. 06/2022/ND-CP[[26]](#footnote-25), as amended and supplemented by Decree No. 119/2025/ND-CP[[27]](#footnote-26), along with technical guidance in Circular No. 17/2022/TT-BTNMT[[28]](#footnote-27). These domestic regulations are complemented by international standards such as the GHG Protocol[[29]](#footnote-28) and TCVN ISO 14064-1:2018[[30]](#footnote-29) to ensure consistency and global recognition.\nThe process typically includes four key steps:\n##\n## Step 1: Define operational boundaries and classify emission sources\nAn enterprise must first define its operational boundaries to identify all activities that produce GHG emissions. These sources are then categorized into three internationally recognized \"scopes\" to prevent double counting and provide a clear picture of the company's climate impact:\n### Scope 1: Direct emissions\nDirect emissions from activities owned or controlled by the enterprise, such as fuel combustion in trucks, machinery, boilers, or refrigerant leakage from air conditioners.\n### Scope 2: Indirect emissions\nIndirect emissions from the use of purchased energy such as electricity, steam, or heat (e.g., electricity purchased from EVN).\n###\n### Scope 3: Other indirect emissions\nOther indirect emissions outside the direct control of the enterprise, such as emissions from suppliers, outsourced transportation, business travel, waste disposal, or the use of products after consumption.\n![A diagram of a process  AI-generated content may be incorrect.](data:image/png;base64...)\n| Criteria | Scope 1 - Direct emissions | Scope 2 - Indirect emissions from Purchased energy | Scope 3 - Other indirect emissions from Value chain |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Definition | GHGs generated directly from company-controlled activities. | GHGs generated indirectly from the use of purchased energy (electricity, steam, heat, cooling). | All other indirect emissions arising throughout the value chain (upstream and downstream). |\n| Location of Emissions | On-site (within company facilities). | Off-site, as a result of purchased energy. | Outside internal operations, across the entire value chain. |\n| Level of Control | High - directly measurable and controllable. | Medium - depends on energy supplier choice. | Low to medium - requires cooperation and data from partners. |\n| Main Emissions Sources | • On-site fuel combustion (coal, oil, natural gas)  • Company-owned vehicles  • Industrial processes (CO₂, N₂O, etc.)  • Refrigerant leaks (HFCs) | • Purchased electricity from grid  • Purchased steam, heat, or cooling | • Purchased goods and services  • Upstream logistics  • Business travel and commuting  • Product use and disposal  • Investments, franchises, leased assets |\n| Measurement Method | Direct measurement or fuel-based calculation. | Two approaches:  • Location-based: uses the average grid emission factor.  • Market-based: uses supplier-specific factors. | Indirect estimation via:  • Supply chain data  • Industry emission factors  • Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) |\n| Transparency & Control | High – data readily available. | Medium – must disclose both calculation methods. | Low to medium – depends on supply chain transparency. |\n| Typical Emission Share | ~10-15% of total company emissions. | ~10-20% depending on electricity source. | Up to 70-80% in sectors such as textiles, food, retail, electronics. |\n***Table 4:*** *Comparison of Emission Scopes*\n##\n## Step 2: Select and collect activity data for the facility-level GHG inventory\nEnterprises should compile quantitative data on emission-related activities within a reporting period (typically one year).

Companies can refer to: (1) The National Emission Factor Database, to be issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment (as per the revised regulations in Decree 119/2025/ND-CP); (2) The IPCC 2006/2019 Guidelines; or (3) The GHG Protocol Emission Factor Database (if national factors are unavailable).\n##\n## Step 4: Calculate facility-level greenhouse gas emissions\nThe standard formula applied is:\n***GHG Emissions (tonnes CO₂e) = Activity Data × Emission Factor***\nThe emissions from all activities are then summed across all three scopes to determine the company's total annual carbon footprint. This final figure is essential for setting internal reduction targets, developing credible carbon credit projects, and complying with regulatory mechanisms like CBAM or Vietnam’s upcoming ETS.\nTo simplify the process, SMEs can use GHG calculation tools, such as GHG Protocol Calculation Tools[[32]](#footnote-31), or SIMAP (from the University of New Hampshire).[[33]](#footnote-32)",

    "question": "Is indirect emissions in the supply chain (Scope 3) mandatory to calculate? Should SMEs calculate it?",
    "answer": "Indirect emissions occurring within the value chain (Scope 3) are a key indicator of an enterprise's comprehensive and substantive commitment to managing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Although not yet mandatory under Vietnam's current legal framework, calculating Scope 3 is increasingly becoming an essential \"passport\" for SMEs to participate in global supply chains.\n###\n## From a legal perspective\nAccording to Decree No. 06/2022/ND-CP, as amended and supplemented by Decree No. 119/2025/ND-CP, the calculation of Scope 3 emissions is not yet a mandatory requirement for the majority of small and medium-sized enterprises in Vietnam. Current regulations primarily focus on compelling enterprises to report on Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased energy).\n###\n## From a strategic perspective\nWhile not legally mandated, calculating Scope 3 emissions should be considered a strategic priority. Market pressures and partner requirements are rapidly transforming this voluntary action into a de facto necessity.\n***Pressure from the supply chain***\nLarge corporations and foreign direct investment (FDI) enterprises are increasingly obligated to report their own Scope 3 emissions. As a result, they require their suppliers, often SMEs, to provide emission data to complete their comprehensive GHG inventories. According to a 2022 report by PwC[[37]](#footnote-36), over 80% of Vietnamese enterprises have committed or will commit to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, cascading these data disclosure requirements down their supply chains.²\n***Global trend***\nInternational regulations like the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) are extending transparency requirements throughout entire value chains. SMEs, as integral links, will inevitably face demands for this data to enable their partners' compliance.\n***Practical impact***\nIn many sectors such as textiles, food, and consumer goods, Scope 3 can account for the vast majority (often over 70%) of a company's total carbon footprint. Calculating these emissions helps SMEs identify the most significant \"hotspots\" and develop targeted reduction strategies, such as optimizing transportation and logistics routes, selecting suppliers with lower carbon footprints, and minimizing waste in production and packaging.\n###\n## Challenges and solutions for SMEs\nCalculating Scope 3 emissions is complex as it relies heavily on data from external partners. However, SMEs are not expected to measure all 15 categories at once.

    "question": "Methodological Database of Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and Gold Standard",
    "answer": "In the global voluntary carbon market, the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and Gold Standard (GS) are the two most reputable and widely used certification standards. A core component of both systems is their extensive methodological database, which functions as a global \"library of technical rules.\" These databases contain detailed, peer-reviewed methodologies that projects must follow to accurately measure, report, and verify (MRV) their emission reductions in order to be eligible for carbon credit issuance.\n###\n## VCS - Verified Carbon Standard (managed by Verra)\nThe VCS program focuses on the accuracy, reliability, and scalability of greenhouse gas emission reductions. Its foundation is a portfolio of hundreds of approved methodologies covering nearly every conceivable project type, including renewable energy, forestry and land use, waste management, and agriculture. These methodologies are designed to ensure consistency and transparency, providing a robust framework for quantifying real emission reductions.\nVCS is the most prevalent standard in the international voluntary carbon market. It is particularly well-suited for large-scale projects due to its flexibility, broad range of applicable methodologies, and wide acceptance among carbon credit buyers.[[39]](#footnote-38)\n###\n## Gold Standard (co-founded by WWF)\nIn addition to rigorous requirements for quantifying and verifying emission reductions, the Gold Standard places a unique emphasis on ensuring projects contribute to sustainable development co-benefits and engage in meaningful local stakeholder consultation. GS methodologies often integrate strict social and environmental safeguards and require projects to demonstrate positive impacts on metrics such as air quality, public health, education, or gender equality, alongside carbon reductions.\nGold Standard credits often command a premium price because they carry a comprehensive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) narrative. They are highly valued by organizations seeking to demonstrate a holistic commitment to social and environmental responsibility through their climate actions.[[40]](#footnote-39)\n###\n## Significance for Businesses in Vietnam\nVietnamese enterprises aiming to develop projects for the international carbon market can freely access the VCS and GS methodology databases on their official websites.

    "question": "What low-cost emission reduction solutions are suitable for SMEs in Vietnam?",
    "answer": "For Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions does not necessarily require high-tech solutions or large capital investments. Many low-cost yet highly effective measures can be implemented immediately within daily operations, helping to reduce operating costs while enhancing the company's reputation among partners and customers. Based on both local research and international studies, the following three groups of solutions are particularly suitable for the conditions of Vietnamese SMEs.[[41]](#footnote-40)\nFirst, improving energy efficiency is an accessible approach that yields quick results. Businesses can begin by replacing energy-intensive equipment, such as upgrading fluorescent lighting to LEDs or investing in higher-efficiency air conditioners and motors. Furthermore, implementing a schedule for regular machine maintenance and checking for leaks in compressed air systems can significantly reduce \"invisible\" energy losses. Simple behavioral changes within the organization, such as turning off equipment when not in use and maximizing the use of natural light, also deliver substantial savings but are often overlooked.\nSecond, adopting circular economy principles in waste management offers dual benefits. Implementing waste separation at the source according to the 3R principles (Reduce - Reuse - Recycle) not only helps SMEs lower their waste disposal costs but can also create additional revenue streams from the sale of recyclable materials. This approach aligns with Vietnam's growing emphasis on sustainable production and resource management.\nThird, optimizing operational processes presents numerous low-cost opportunities. Shifting to digital solutions like electronic invoices, e-contracts, and cloud-based data storage minimizes resource consumption and enhances administrative efficiency. In the logistics sector, optimizing transportation routes to reduce mileage and minimize empty-running vehicles is a highly effective strategy. Similarly, organizing online meetings in place of long-distance business travel directly cuts emissions from transportation.\nIn summary, SMEs can confidently begin their emission reduction journey with small, practical, and low-cost actions that generate positive impacts on both the environment and their bottom line. Taking these initial steps is crucial for building a credible, long-term, sustainable development strategy and preparing for future market demands.",

    "question": "Can SMEs jointly implement a common project to share the costs of Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV)?",
    "answer": "This collaborative model is one of the most effective approaches for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). It is officially recognized in international carbon markets as a Programme of Activities (PoA), also known as a grouped project. Vietnamese law provides a clear legal framework for this model, enabling SMEs to overcome common barriers to market entry.\n## PoA mechanism\nThe Programme of Activities (PoA) mechanism operates under a \"hub-and-spoke\" structure designed to aggregate small-scale climate projects. A central Coordinating/Managing Entity (CME), which can be an industry association, a consulting firm, or a large corporation, takes the lead. This CME is responsible for developing and registering a single framework \"programme\" with a relevant authority, such as Verra, Gold Standard, or Vietnam's national body. Individual Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) with similar emission reduction activities, such as installing rooftop solar panels, constructing biogas digesters, or adopting specific energy-saving technologies across multiple sites, can then join this pre-approved programme, with each participating project being considered a Component Project Activity (CPA).\nIn Vietnam's legal context, while Decree 06/2022/ND-CP laid the initial groundwork, Decree 119/2025/ND-CP has further clarified the registration and implementation process for such \"programmes\" and \"projects\" under both domestic and international mechanisms, explicitly including those compliant with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The regulations for registering projects, as detailed in the amended decrees, apply to both individual projects and these larger programmes of activities.\nThe benefits for SMEs participating in this model are very clear, as it directly addresses their primary market entry barriers. Firstly, cost sharing dramatically reduces the financial burden that often prevents individual SMEs from accessing the carbon market; this is because the significant costs associated with technical consultancy, developing methodologies, and undergoing the entire validation and verification (the core of MRV) are shared among all participants. Secondly, the PoA offers simplified procedures. SMEs do not need to develop a complex Project Design Document (PDD) from scratch. Instead, they follow the pre-approved framework, methodologies, and monitoring plans already established by the CME, which significantly streamlines the registration process for each individual CPA. Finally, the model provides increased market attractiveness. By aggregating the emission reductions from multiple small projects, a PoA generates a larger, more consistent volume of carbon credits. This makes the credits more appealing and marketable to both domestic and international buyers, who often prefer to purchase in larger quantities.\n#",

    "question": "How long does it usually take for a project to be registered, verified, and issued carbon credits?",
    "answer": "The timeline for registering a domestic carbon credit project in Vietnam is detailed in the newly amended regulations. While the process is structured, the total duration can vary based on the project's complexity and the quality of the submitted documentation.\nThe official administrative process for project registration and approval, as stipulated in Decree No. 119/2025/ND-CP (amending Article 20 of Decree 06/2022/ND-CP), involves the following key steps handled by the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment:\n***Dossier validity check (03 working days)***\nThe line ministry checks the completeness and validity of the initial application dossier. If incomplete, the project owner is notified. The time for the owner to supplement the dossier is not counted in the official processing time.\n***Public consultation (30 days)***\nThe line ministry posts the project registration application on its web portal to solicit widespread public comments for a period of 30 days.\n***Appraisal request (05 working days)***\nAfter the public consultation period ends, the line ministry sends an official request for appraisal to an accredited appraisal unit (a third-party verifier).\n***Project appraisal (60 days)***\nThe appraisal unit has a maximum of 60 days from receiving the request to conduct a technical appraisal of the project and send the appraisal report back to the line ministry.\n***Final stakeholder opinion (10 days)***\nThe line ministry sends the appraisal report to relevant state agencies to solicit final opinions. These agencies have 10 days to respond.\n***Final decision (07 working days)***\nAfter receiving all final opinions, the line ministry has 07 working days to review and issue the official decision to approve the project registration.\nSumming up these official steps, the minimum administrative timeline from submitting a valid dossier to receiving a final approval decision is approximately 115 working days, which is equivalent to about 5.5 months. This does not include the time project owners take to supplement dossiers or any potential delays. Therefore, a realistic estimate for the project registration phase alone is 6 to 8 months.\nThe journey from project conception to the actual issuance of tradable carbon credits is a lengthy, multi-stage process. The timeline begins with a pre-registration phase, where the detailed Project Design Document (PDD) and other necessary forms are prepared, a step that can take several months to complete. Following the project's successful registration, it enters a mandatory monitoring period, which typically lasts at least one year. During this time, the project must be fully operational to generate and meticulously record the resulting emission reductions. Once the monitoring period is complete, the verification and issuance stage begins. This requires the project owner to first prepare a comprehensive monitoring report and then hire an accredited verification body to independently audit its contents, a process that can take an additional one to three months.

    "content": "Question: How long does it usually take for a project to be registered, verified, and issued carbon credits?\n\nAnswer: The timeline for registering a domestic carbon credit project in Vietnam is detailed in the newly amended regulations. While the process is structured, the total duration can vary based on the project's complexity and the quality of the submitted documentation.\nThe official administrative process for project registration and approval, as stipulated in Decree No. 119/2025/ND-CP (amending Article 20 of Decree 06/2022/ND-CP), involves the following key steps handled by the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment:\n***Dossier validity check (03 working days)***\nThe line ministry checks the completeness and validity of the initial application dossier. If incomplete, the project owner is notified. The time for the owner to supplement the dossier is not counted in the official processing time.\n***Public consultation (30 days)***\nThe line ministry posts the project registration application on its web portal to solicit widespread public comments for a period of 30 days.\n***Appraisal request (05 working days)***\nAfter the public consultation period ends, the line ministry sends an official request for appraisal to an accredited appraisal unit (a third-party verifier).\n***Project appraisal (60 days)***\nThe appraisal unit has a maximum of 60 days from receiving the request to conduct a technical appraisal of the project and send the appraisal report back to the line ministry.\n***Final stakeholder opinion (10 days)***\nThe line ministry sends the appraisal report to relevant state agencies to solicit final opinions. These agencies have 10 days to respond.\n***Final decision (07 working days)***\nAfter receiving all final opinions, the line ministry has 07 working days to review and issue the official decision to approve the project registration.\nSumming up these official steps, the minimum administrative timeline from submitting a valid dossier to receiving a final approval decision is approximately 115 working days, which is equivalent to about 5.5 months. This does not include the time project owners take to supplement dossiers or any potential delays. Therefore, a realistic estimate for the project registration phase alone is 6 to 8 months.\nThe journey from project conception to the actual issuance of tradable carbon credits is a lengthy, multi-stage process. The timeline begins with a pre-registration phase, where the detailed Project Design Document (PDD) and other necessary forms are prepared, a step that can take several months to complete. Following the project's successful registration, it enters a mandatory monitoring period, which typically lasts at least one year. During this time, the project must be fully operational to generate and meticulously record the resulting emission reductions. Once the monitoring period is complete, the verification and issuance stage begins. This requires the project owner to first prepare a comprehensive monitoring report and then hire an accredited verification body to independently audit its contents, a process that can take an additional one to three months. The final step involves submitting this verified report to the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment with a formal request for the carbon credits to be issued into the National Registry. Therefore, from the initial project design to the first issuance of credits, the entire timeline can realistically extend to 18 months or more.\n#",

    "question": "What is the specific MRV process according to the guidance of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment?",
    "answer": "The Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) process in Vietnam, as defined by recent decrees and coordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, is a structured, multi-layered system. It consists of three primary stages:\n##\n## Stage 1: Measurement\nThe initial stage of Measurement is the direct responsibility of the enterprise. Throughout the annual reporting period, from January 1 to December 31, companies must systematically collect, monitor, and store activity data relevant to their GHG emissions, such as fuel consumption, electricity usage, input materials, or the number of livestock. The calculation requires the application of appropriate emission factors, which must be selected according to a strict order of priority: first, a facility-specific factor if one has been developed and recognized; second, a national factor from the official database published by MONRE; and third, a default factor from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) if the others are unavailable. Emissions are then calculated using the standard formula (*GHG Emissions = Activity Data × Emission Factor*), and the entire process must adhere to the specific technical guidelines issued by the relevant line ministries for each sector.\n###\n## Stage 2: Reporting\nThe Reporting stage formalizes this data into a standardized national workflow that moves from the local to the national level. At the facility level, enterprises must prepare the \"Report on GHG Emission Mitigation\" using the official Form No. 02 found in Appendix III of Decree No. 06/2022/ND-CP; this report integrates the results of the GHG inventory with information on any mitigation activities undertaken. By March 31st of the following year, this report is submitted to the provincial-level People's Committee (PPC) via the National Registry System. The PPC is responsible for receiving the reports, conducting a preliminary review for completeness, and aggregating the data from all facilities within its jurisdiction. Finally, by June 30th annually, each PPC submits its aggregated provincial report to Ministry. As the national focal point, Ministry synthesizes these reports along with those from line ministries to develop the National Synthesis Report, which is crucial for tracking progress toward Vietnam's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and fulfilling its international reporting obligations.\n###\n## Stage 3: Verification\nThe final stage, Verification, ensures the accuracy and reliability of the reported data through several layers of review. This begins with internal verification, where enterprises must implement their own Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures before submission, followed by an administrative review for completeness by the receiving PPC. For any data intended for market-based activities, such as allocating emission quotas, trading allowances, or issuing carbon credits, mandatory third-party verification is required. The verification must be conducted by an independent body licensed according to national regulations; notably, these regulations were simplified by Decree No. 119/2025/ND-CP to encourage greater participation from domestic verification organizations. At the highest level, Ministry will establish an Appraisal Council to evaluate the national and sectoral synthesis reports. This council's appraisal ensures national-level data integrity before the reports are officially published or used in international communications.",

    "question": "What price (USD/credit) can SME enterprises expect for selling carbon credits?",
    "answer": "The value of a carbon credit currently fluctuates significantly depending on the market, project type, geographical location, and the added value the project delivers. In Vietnam, the average price of carbon credits ranges around 5 USD/ton CO₂, with the voluntary market recording a range from approximately 3.8 to 7.45 USD/credit.[[43]](#footnote-42) Globally, prices can range from under 1 USD up to over 100 USD/ton CO₂, with some long-term forecasts suggesting prices could reach 238 USD by 2050, depending on increasing demand and the reliability of the measurement and verification system.[[44]](#footnote-43)\nThe factors determining carbon credit prices can be categorized into six main groups. Firstly, the project type plays an essential role: nature-based solutions projects, such as forest conservation, tend to be priced higher due to their association with multiple co-benefits like biodiversity and community livelihoods. Meanwhile, technology projects like Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) often face lower price ranges but have high scalability potential. Secondly, geographical location and the stringency of the local legal framework strongly influence investor expectations and market acceptance. Thirdly, co-benefits, such as contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), often help enhance the commercial value of the credits.[[45]](#footnote-44) Fourthly, the supply-demand relationship is the fundamental economic factor governing the entire market; increased demand for high-quality credits will lead to an upward price trend.\nFurthermore, the technological sophistication also affects the price: credits generated from common, low-cost technologies often face price competition, whereas credits derived from new technologies, which involve high complexity and risk, are priced higher to offset investment costs. Finally, the distinction between compliance markets and voluntary carbon markets (VCM) also contributes to establishing a more flexible pricing mechanism within the VCM.\nIn Vietnam, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has proposed applying a floor price of 5 USD/ton CO₂ for forest carbon credits to encourage localities to participate in the carbon market and enhance the economic value of forest resources.[[46]](#footnote-45) Additionally, a report from Ecosystem Marketplace (2025) indicates that the global weighted average price for voluntary carbon credits in 2021 was 4.73 USD/credit, suggesting that Vietnam is currently positioning itself at a price level comparable to the regional average.",

    "question": "What green credit options are being offered by domestic banks such as BIDV and VietinBank?",
    "answer": "Currently, many commercial banks in Vietnam, such as BIDV and VietinBank, are actively implementing green credit programs to support businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in investing in environmentally friendly activities. These loans are designed to finance projects in renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste treatment, green transportation, and other sustainable development initiatives.[[47]](#footnote-46)\nThe Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV) is one of the pioneers in green credit, supported by international organizations such as the World Bank (WB), the French Development Agency (AFD), and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). BIDV offers preferential loans for projects such as rooftop solar power, wind power, energy-saving technology improvements, and wastewater treatment. Preferential interest rates can range from 5.5% to 7.5% per annum, with flexible loan terms of up to 10-15 years. Furthermore, BIDV also implements other green financial products such as green bonds, green deposits, sustainability-linked loans, and Green Trade Loans.[[48]](#footnote-47) [[49]](#footnote-48)\nVietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade (VietinBank)[[50]](#footnote-49) is also promoting its “Green Finance” program with the GreenUP green credit package valued at VND 5,000 billion, targeting clean energy, wastewater treatment, cleaner production, and environmental protection sectors. VietinBank collaborates with development organizations such as GIZ (German Agency for International Cooperation)[[51]](#footnote-50) and AFD to support businesses in developing environmental profiles and assessing carbon impact. The Bank also applies a Sustainable Finance Framework and offers preferential interest rates depending on the environmental outcomes of the project.\nBesides BIDV and VietinBank, banks such as TPBank, HDBank, SHB, MSB, and ACB are also implementing green financing programs based on support from international organizations such as IFC (International Finance Corporation)[[52]](#footnote-51), ADB (Asian Development Bank[[53]](#footnote-52)), and JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency). Financing methods include performance-based lending and blended finance.\nHowever, current challenges include the lack of unified green standards and the absence of a clear legal framework for green credit for SMEs. Therefore, enterprises should directly contact the corporate credit departments at banks to find suitable loan packages, develop a transparent MRV (Measurement, Reporting, and Verification) plan, and cooperate with specialized organizations to receive technical support and access capital sources.",

    "searchable_text": "Question: What green credit options are being offered by domestic banks such as BIDV and VietinBank?\n\nAnswer: Currently, many commercial banks in Vietnam, such as BIDV and VietinBank, are actively implementing green credit programs to support businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in investing in environmentally friendly activities. These loans are designed to finance projects in renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste treatment, green transportation, and other sustainable development initiatives.[[47]](#footnote-46)\nThe Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV) is one of the pioneers in green credit, supported by international organizations such as the World Bank (WB), the French Development Agency (AFD), and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). BIDV offers preferential loans for projects such as rooftop solar power, wind power, energy-saving technology improvements, and wastewater treatment. Preferential interest rates can range from 5.5% to 7.5% per annum, with flexible loan terms of up to 10-15 years. Furthermore, BIDV also implements other green financial products such as green bonds, green deposits, sustainability-linked loans, and Green Trade Loans.[[48]](#footnote-47) [[49]](#footnote-48)\nVietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade (VietinBank)[[50]](#footnote-49) is also promoting its “Green Finance” program with the GreenUP green credit package valued at VND 5,000 billion, targeting clean energy, wastewater treatment, cleaner production, and environmental protection sectors.

    "question": "How should SMEs plan costs for MRV activities?",
    "answer": "MRV (Measurement - Reporting - Verification) activities are a mandatory and costly stage in the carbon credit project development chain, especially for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam. This is a prerequisite for carbon credits to be recognized and brought to market. Total MRV costs for a 5-year SME project can range from USD 15,000 to USD 40,000, covering items such as baseline establishment, Project Design Document (PDD), periodic data monitoring, and independent verification.

    "question": "What are the financial risks that SMEs need to be aware of (e.g., price volatility, increased verification costs)?",
    "answer": "Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) participating in the carbon credit market need to pay special attention to a range of financial risks that could affect the feasibility and investment efficiency of their projects. Firstly, the risk of carbon credit price volatility is one of the biggest challenges. In the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM), prices can fluctuate sharply depending on the type of credit, the certification standard (such as Verra, Gold Standard), and accompanying factors like sustainability benefits. According to a report by Ecosystem Marketplace (2025)[[65]](#footnote-64), Verra credit prices have fluctuated from USD 3 to USD 15, and at times even dropped below USD 2. To mitigate this risk, SMEs should consider signing forward contracts and choosing high-standard projects that come with clear social and environmental co-benefits.\nSecondly, the costs for the Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) process are often higher than anticipated. Expenses such as baseline establishment, Project Design Document (PDD) preparation, periodic monitoring, and independent verification can result in costs of up to USD 15,000-40,000 for SMEs over a 5-year cycle (Verra, 2023). The solution is for SMEs to allocate an additional 20–30% budget contingency and utilize the grouped project approach to share costs.\nThirdly, the current low liquidity of the domestic market makes selling carbon credits difficult. The lack of an official exchange in Vietnam increases the risk of credits being inventoried or sold at a loss. Therefore, SMEs should proactively seek partners early, sign Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), or connect with international platforms such as AirCarbon Exchange or South Pole.\nFurthermore, policy change is a major risk given that Vietnam's Emissions Trading System (ETS) is currently in the pilot phase. Changes in quotas, technical standards, or legal regulations could cause some credits to lose value. Businesses should regularly monitor information from the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, participate in policy forums, and prioritize highly linkable international standards such as JCM, VCS, or Gold Standard.\nFinally, risks related to transparency and ethics are also noteworthy. If a project is suspected of lacking additionality or being involved in greenwashing, the credits will be difficult to accept in the market. SMEs should ensure transparency throughout the entire cycle, use reputable verification bodies, and link projects to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).[[66]](#footnote-65) [[67]](#footnote-66) [[68]](#footnote-67)",

    "question": "How to value co-benefits such as contributions to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or biodiversity conservation?",
    "answer": "In the context where the global carbon credit market increasingly focuses on added values beyond emission reduction factors, accurately valuing co-benefits such as contributions to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or biodiversity conservation becomes particularly important, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in Vietnam. To achieve this, several internationally recognized and widely applied approaches have been established.\nFirstly, the application of credit verification standards that integrate co-benefit criteria, such as the Gold Standard for the Global Goals or Verra CCB (Climate, Community & Biodiversity), is a necessary step. These standards not only require projects to contribute to at least three SDGs but also provide quantitative toolkits, such as the SDG Impact Tool, to measure, report, and verify specific indicators regarding the environmental and social impacts of the project.\nSecondly, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) projects that include biodiversity benefits are prioritized and valued higher by the market. According to the Ecosystem Marketplace report (2022), carbon credits from nature projects can be traded at prices 5 to 18 USD/tCO₂e higher than conventional credits, owing to the synergistic value derived from ecological conservation, climate regulation, and native ecosystem restoration.\nThirdly, to specifically quantify the value of co-benefits, several new tools and models have been developed. The SDG Co-benefit Framework model is a typical example, allowing scores to be calculated for each relevant SDG and generating a composite impact index, thereby supporting the negotiation of credit prices in the market. Similarly, the Biodiversity Impact Credit (BIC) system is also designed as a standard unit for valuing biodiversity within carbon credits.[[76]](#footnote-75)\nFourthly, traditional environmental economics methods such as replacement cost, social cost of biodiversity, or contingent valuation can also be applied by SMEs to build financial justifications. These tools, which are common in the Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) mechanism, can help businesses value non-market benefits such as climate regulation, flood control, or pollination services.\nPractically, the co-benefit valuation process needs to be tightly integrated into the steps of developing and operating carbon credit projects. Businesses should start by clearly identifying the appropriate SDGs and types of co-benefits, using standard indicator sets for quantification, and then integrating these values into the MRV framework and credit pricing. Promoting these benefits to customers and investors not only increases credibility but also helps businesses access the premium carbon credit market.\nIn summary, valuing co-benefits in carbon credit projects not only enhances economic value but also serves as a strategic tool for businesses to build a sustainable image, create a competitive advantage, and access green finance sources more effectively in the context of transitioning towards a low-carbon economy.[[77]](#footnote-76) [[78]](#footnote-77) [[79]](#footnote-78) [[80]](#footnote-79)",

    "question": "Can carbon credits help SMEs cope with the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)?",
    "answer": "In the context of the European Union implementing the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to control the volume of carbon emissions imported into the internal market, Vietnamese exporting enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are facing significant challenges regarding costs and compliance capacity. CBAM requires businesses to declare the emissions embedded in exported products and may have to purchase CBAM certificates if emissions exceed the benchmark set by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). This is particularly important for sectors such as steel, cement, aluminum, and fertilizers - areas where many Vietnamese enterprises are involved in exporting.[[81]](#footnote-80) [[82]](#footnote-81)\nIn this context, carbon credits can serve as a strategic tool to help businesses demonstrate emission reduction efforts, thereby supporting compliance with CBAM requirements and limiting resulting financial obligations. Although CBAM does not directly accept domestic carbon credits as an official offsetting tool, investing in emission reduction projects verified by international standard systems (such as VCS, Gold Standard, CDM) can help businesses build a transparent profile of lower emission levels.[[83]](#footnote-82) This is a crucial factor during CBAM's transitional phase and in the future when the mechanism is fully implemented starting in 2026.\nFurthermore, participation in the domestic carbon credit market, combined with green financial support programs from the World Bank (WB), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), or the Asian Development Bank (ADB), will help SMEs invest effectively in emission reduction technologies and enhance their ability to adapt to the EU market's environmental standards. Concurrently, integrating carbon credits into the Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system will help businesses better comply with the EU's transparency requirements regarding emissions.\nStrategically, carbon credits also help SMEs enhance their environmental reputation, access high-end export markets, and create a competitive advantage in the global transition towards a low-carbon economy. However, to maximize effectiveness, businesses need technical support in developing carbon projects, MRV declaration, as well as actively participating in training and technology transfer programs suitable for domestic production conditions.",

    "question": "Can businesses apply blockchain technology or QR codes to enhance the transparency of the MRV process?",
    "answer": "Businesses can leverage blockchain technology and QR codes to significantly enhance the transparency, accuracy, and efficiency of the MRV (Measurement, Reporting, and Verification) process. These technologies are increasingly being applied to build trust and automate data management in the field of sustainable development.\n###\n## Blockchain for data integrity and automation\nBlockchain technology offers immense potential for digitizing and securing climate-related data. As highlighted in reports by the World Bank and academic research, blockchain enables the creation of a distributed, immutable ledger.[[102]](#footnote-101) [[103]](#footnote-102) This system allows MRV data to be recorded, verified, and shared in near real-time with high security, making it resistant to tampering.\nKey applications include:\n***Automated MRV***\nWhen integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, smart contracts on a blockchain can automatically trigger data recording. For instance, a sensor detecting that an emission reduction activity has met a pre-defined standard could automatically execute a transaction to log the corresponding carbon data.\n***Transparent carbon markets***\nBlockchain is being used to build more transparent carbon credit markets. Each carbon credit can be \"tokenized\" as a unique digital asset, with its entire lifecycle from issuance to retirement, publicly recorded and auditable on the blockchain. This minimizes the risk of double-counting and enhances the credibility of carbon claims. A notable example is the Open Forest Protocol, an on-chain MRV platform for forestry projects.[[104]](#footnote-103)\n###\n## QR Codes for consumer-facing transparency\nWhile blockchain secures back-end data, QR codes serve as a powerful bridge connecting that data to end-users and consumers. By scanning a QR code on a product's packaging, consumers can instantly access information about its production process, carbon footprint, and supply chain journey.\nProminent initiatives include:\n***Supply chain traceability***\nThe OpenSC platform, co-founded by WWF and Boston Consulting Group, combines blockchain with QR codes to bring transparency to food supply chains, allowing consumers to trace a product's journey from origin to retail.[[105]](#footnote-104) In Vietnam, a UNDP-supported project has applied QR codes to agricultural products like mangoes and dragon fruits to display traceability information and carbon footprint data.[[106]](#footnote-105)\n***Circular economy***\nResearch has demonstrated how combining QR codes and blockchain can track the entire lifecycle of products like PET plastic bottles, providing verifiable data on production dates and recycling rates.[[107]](#footnote-106)\n***Digital Product Passports (DPP)***\nThe European Union is implementing the DPP, which will require products in certain sectors (like textiles and electronics) to feature a QR code or similar data carrier. This will provide consumers with detailed information on materials, origin, repairability, and recycling, with brands like Kappahl and Marimekko already piloting solutions.[[108]](#footnote-107)\nBy integrating blockchain and QR codes, businesses can not only improve their internal GHG management efficiency but also build significant trust with partners, customers, and regulators.

It offers a suite of free resources, including the Business Carbon Calculator, online courses, and actionable guides like the 1.5°C Business Playbook, to help businesses make a climate commitment and measure their progress.\n## Domestic forums and government-led initiatives\nThese platforms are crucial for understanding Vietnam's specific regulatory landscape and connecting with policymakers.\n***Vietnam Carbon Market Forum (VCMF)***[[110]](#footnote-109)\nChaired by the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, the VCMF is a key annual event that brings together policymakers, businesses, financial institutions, and experts. It serves as the primary venue for discussing and updating information on the development of Vietnam's domestic carbon market, aligning efforts toward the nation's net-zero 2050 goal.\n***National Registry System***\nWhile a technical platform, the forthcoming National Registry operated by MONRE will also function as a central information hub, providing official updates and guidance for all participating entities.\n## Business associations & councils\nThese organizations play a vital role in peer-to-peer learning, capacity building, and advocating for business interests in the green transition.\n***Vietnam Business Council for Sustainable Development (VBCSD)***[[111]](#footnote-110)\nAffiliated with the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), the VBCSD is a leading organization that builds networks of pioneering businesses in sustainable development. It regularly organizes training courses, workshops, and publishes guidance documents to support the business community.\n| Project phase | Key actors to connect with | Role & support provided |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1.

In addition to these primary sources, businesses should subscribe to updates from key organizations, such as the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) and the Vietnam Business Council for Sustainable Development (VBCSD), which disseminate valuable summaries and analyses, as well as publications from international organizations like GIZ and UNDP that provide broader context. Furthermore, active participation in industry events, including workshops, webinars, and policy dialogues like the Vietnam Carbon Market Forum (VCMF), offers invaluable opportunities to hear directly from policymakers and network with experts.\nFinally, for more tailored insights, businesses can utilize specialized information services, such as the newsletters and legal updates from major law firms and consulting companies that provide in-depth analysis on how new policies will impact operations.

SMEs in the program receive interest rate reductions upon meeting predefined environmental criteria, including GHG emission reductions and waste management improvements.[[119]](#footnote-118)\n###\n## National and bilateral climate programs\nThese government-led models focus on building national capacity and channeling international climate finance into specific projects.\n***Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF)***\nCoordinated by the World Bank, the FCPF is a multi-layered PPP that supports countries, including Vietnam, in developing national frameworks for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). It facilitates coordination between governments, the private sector, and carbon funds, all while applying an internationally standardized MRV system.[[120]](#footnote-119)\n***Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM)***\nInitiated by the Japanese government, the JCM is a bilateral cooperation model. It provides co-financing, often with partners like the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and JICA, to support SMEs in implementing emission reduction projects in sectors like energy, transport, and forestry across many Asian countries, including Vietnam.[[121]](#footnote-120)\n## Results-based Climate finance and Technical assistance\nThese models offer direct payments or technical support following the successful verification of emission reductions.\n***UNDP's Carbon Payments for Development (CP4D)***\nThis PPP model focuses on post-verification financing. Private enterprises invest in and implement projects (e.g., waste treatment, electric vehicles), and are then partially reimbursed if the project achieves certified emission reductions through an MRV system compliant with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.[[122]](#footnote-121)\n***Climate Technology Centre & Network (CTCN)***\nOperating under the UNFCCC, the CTCN connects private sector technology providers with SMEs in developing countries, including Vietnam. It facilitates non-profit or co-financed technical assistance to help SMEs adopt climate-friendly technologies.[[123]](#footnote-122)\nThese PPP models demonstrate a global shift toward collaborative ecosystems that not only provide financial and technological resources for SMEs but also promote the formation of transparent and efficient carbon markets, which is a crucial condition for developing countries to achieve their climate commitments sustainably.",

    "question": "What is the criterion for assessing \"additionality\" in a project?",
    "answer": "The concept of “additionality” is a core principle of all credible carbon credit mechanisms, including the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and voluntary market standards such as the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and The Gold Standard. Additionality requires project developers to demonstrate that the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions claimed would not have occurred without the incentive created by carbon credit revenues. In other words, a project is considered additional if it overcomes significant barriers, financial, technological, or institutional, that would have prevented its implementation under a “business-as-usual” scenario. Ensuring additionality is fundamental to the environmental integrity of the carbon market, as it prevents credits from being issued for activities that would have happened anyway. According to guidelines developed by the UNFCCC and adopted by major standards, there are three primary methods for assessing additionality.[[128]](#footnote-127)\n## Barrier analysis\nFirst, barrier analysis requires the developer to show that the project faces obstacles overcome only through carbon finance incentives, including financial barriers (e.g., high investment costs, long payback periods, or unfavorable lending conditions), technological barriers (e.g., new or unproven technologies with significant risks), and institutional barriers (e.g., social, regulatory, or organizational challenges).\n## Comparison with a Baseline Scenario (Investment or Common Practice Analysis)\nSecond, comparison with a baseline scenario, also known as investment or common practice analysis, evaluates the project against credible alternatives to determine what would most likely happen without it; if the project is less financially attractive or not common practice, it can be deemed additional. This analysis must be substantiated with objective evidence such as historical operational records, sector-wide data, or financial modeling.\n## Application of Formal Additionality Tools\nThird, formal additionality tools, such as the UNFCCC’s “Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality,” provide a step-by-step logic test, including identification of feasible alternatives, barrier analysis, and sector common practice evaluation.\nAn illustrative example is a small-scale pig farm in Vietnam emitting methane from traditional waste lagoons. The farm owner wants to install an anaerobic digester and generator to capture methane and produce electricity. The upfront investment is prohibitively high relative to the farm’s profits, and revenue from electricity sales alone is insufficient to make the project financially viable. If the developer can demonstrate these financial barriers using audited statements, investment models, and loan assessments, the project would likely be considered additional, as carbon credit revenues are essential for its implementation. For SMEs, demonstrating additionality can be challenging but is a non-negotiable requirement; by designing projects that clearly meet these criteria and transparently documenting the evidence in the Project Design Document (PDD), SMEs can successfully register their projects and access a valuable new revenue stream from the carbon market.",

Failure to achieve these committed targets directly affects the number of carbon credits a project can receive and can have broader consequences on finance, reputation, and the feasibility of future climate initiatives.\n## Consequences of failing to meet targets\n### Non-issuance of credits for the shortfall\nCarbon credit standards such as The Gold Standard and the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) operate on an “issuance upon verification” principle. Credits are issued only for verified emission reductions. For example, if a project commits to reducing 10,000 tCO₂ but the verified report shows only 6,000 tCO₂ was achieved, the project will receive 6,000 credits, and the 4,000 tCO₂ shortfall generates no credits.[[129]](#footnote-128) [[130]](#footnote-129)\n###\n### Loss of credibility with the market and investors\nRepeatedly failing to meet projected targets increases perceived risk for investors, credit registries, and potential buyers. This can negatively impact a project’s ability to secure renewal for subsequent crediting periods, enter long-term Emission Reduction Purchase Agreements (ERPAs), or mobilize finance from climate funds or international development organizations.\n### Mandatory corrective action and reporting\nLeading international standards require transparency regarding performance shortfalls. Project owners must clearly state the reasons for underperformance in the monitoring report, update MRV documentation to explain technical or operational factors affecting results, and propose corrective actions for the next monitoring period. In some contractual cases, if a project has an offtake agreement to deliver a specific volume of credits, it may also need to purchase and retire credits from the open market to fulfill its commitment to the buyer.\n## Illustrative example\nA cement plant in Vietnam implements a waste heat recovery project with a target of reducing 50,000 tCO₂ per year. However, unforeseen technical issues cause the system to operate at only 60% of its expected efficiency during the first year. As a result, the actual verified emission reduction is only 30,000 tCO₂, and the project is issued 30,000 carbon credits for that year. The monitoring report must detail the technical failure, explain the reasons behind it, and outline a plan for repairs. If the plant had a contractual obligation to sell 35,000 credits to an investor, it might need to purchase 5,000 credits from the market to cover the shortfall.\n## Recommendations for SMEs\nTo mitigate such risks, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) should develop a realistic and detailed implementation and monitoring plan, set conservative and evidence-based emission reduction targets rather than overly ambitious ones, invest in a robust MRV system from the start to enable accurate progress tracking, and include technical and financial contingencies in the project plan to address potential operational risks.",

    "question": "How to control the risk of leakage and ensure permanence?",
    "answer": "## Explanation of concepts\nLeakage is the phenomenon in which greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increase in another location as an indirect consequence of implementing an emission reduction project in a specific area, reducing the true effectiveness of the project if left uncontrolled. For example, a reforestation project that causes local residents to lose agricultural land might unintentionally drive them to deforest neighboring areas, creating new emissions. Permanence, on the other hand, refers to the long-term maintenance of GHG reductions or removals. If the reductions are reversed, due to events such as forest fires or post-project deforestation, the environmental benefits are lost.\n## Measures to control leakage and enhance permanence\nInternational standards, such as the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), particularly for Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) projects, require developers to implement specific measures to manage these risks.[[131]](#footnote-130) [[132]](#footnote-131)\n### Leakage risk assessment in project design\nDuring the Project Design Document (PDD) phase, a thorough leakage risk assessment must be conducted, evaluating indirect impacts like land-use shifts, livelihood pressures, or market effects. Where significant risks are identified, mitigation measures may include establishing buffer zones, supporting alternative livelihoods, or discounting claimed credits to account for leakage.\n### Establishing a “buffer pool” for non-permanence risk\nTo address the risk of non-permanence, standards like VCS require projects to contribute a percentage of their issued carbon credits to a central \"buffer pool.\" This pool acts as a shared insurance mechanism against unavoidable reversals (e.g., natural disasters like wildfires or floods). The contribution percentage is determined by a project-specific non-permanence risk assessment, typically ranging from 10% to 20%. Credits held in the buffer pool are not tradable and are cancelled if a reversal event occurs, ensuring the overall integrity of the carbon market.\n### Long-term Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV)\nAFOLU projects require a long-term commitment to monitoring. Project activities, forest carbon stocks, ecosystems, and community impacts must be monitored periodically (e.g., annually or every five years). MRV reports must be continuously updated to detect any factors that could affect permanence or cause leakage, allowing for timely corrective actions.\nIllustrative example\n## Illustrative example\nA reforestation project in Vietnam’s Central Highlands aims to sequester CO₂ through assisted natural regeneration. The design phase identifies risks such as high illegal logging pressure near a timber transport route, medium wildfire risk during the dry season, and potential impacts on local livelihoods due to restricted access. The project addresses these by contributing 15% of issued credits to the VCS buffer pool, establishing protective buffer zones and community patrols, providing fire prevention training and efficient cookstoves, and implementing a monitoring plan with annual site visits and a full risk reassessment every five years. By correctly implementing these risk management measures, SMEs can enhance project credibility, reduce legal and reputational risks, and ensure their carbon credits meet the high-quality standards expected by international buyers.",

    "question": "What is Vietnam doing to prevent double counting?",
    "answer": "## The concept of “double counting”\n“Double counting” occurs when a single greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction or removal is claimed by two or more entities to meet their climate targets. A common example is when the host country counts an emission reduction toward its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), while an international buyer—another country or a corporation—also uses the same reduction to offset its own emissions or achieve net-zero goals. This practice undermines the environmental integrity of the carbon market and risks compromising the global objectives of the Paris Agreement. To prevent this, Vietnam has established a clear legal and institutional framework, primarily through Decree No. 06/2022/ND-CP and its amendments in Decree No. 119/2025/ND-CP. These regulations set out measures to ensure that each emission reduction is uniquely accounted for, tracked, and reported, maintaining transparency and credibility in both domestic and international carbon markets.\n## Establishing a National Carbon Credit Database System (MRV Registry)\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Environment is developing the National Registration and Monitoring System for emissions, emission reductions, and carbon credits, also known as the MRV Registry. This system manages the entire lifecycle of a carbon credit, from generation through MRV, verification, and transaction, to its cancellation or use for the national NDC. Acting as the central control mechanism, it prevents a single credit from being recorded or claimed multiple times, thereby safeguarding environmental integrity.\n## Clearly stipulating responsibility for claiming credit ownership\nEach emission reduction project must identify the entity that owns the credits after verification. Ownership responsibility is formally recorded in the project documentation and MRV report. In cross-border transactions, projects must commit either not to use these credits toward the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) or, if they are used, to apply a corresponding adjustment.\n## Connecting with international mechanisms under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement\nVietnam is also implementing an international coordination mechanism under Article 6.2, which allows countries to cooperate in achieving NDC targets through the transfer of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs). When ITMOs are transferred, Vietnam applies corresponding adjustments by subtracting the sold credits from its national emission reduction results to prevent double counting with the buyer or partner country. These adjustments are reflected in the Biennial Transparency Report (BTR) submitted to the UNFCCC.\n## Illustrative example\nA steel manufacturing enterprise in Thai Nguyen implements a project that uses blast furnace exhaust gas for power generation, achieving annual reductions of 30,000 tCO₂. The enterprise registers these credits according to international standards and plans to sell them to a partner in Europe to help the buyer meet its net-zero target. For this transaction to be valid, Vietnam must record the credits in the national MRV Registry, ensure the enterprise does not simultaneously use the reductions for reporting in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), and apply a corresponding adjustment by subtracting 30,000 tCO₂ from the national emission reduction results, which is then reflected in the UNFCCC report. Without this mechanism, the same 30,000 tCO₂ could be claimed twice, once in Vietnam’s NDC and once by the EU buyer, undermining credibility and risking rejection in international markets.\n## Significance for SME Businesses\nCompliance with Vietnam’s double-counting prevention mechanism is mandatory for SMEs wishing to legally trade carbon credits internationally, have credits recognized in mandatory markets such as CORSIA or the EU ETS, or participate in bilateral cooperation mechanisms under the Paris Agreement (e.g., Japan’s Joint Crediting Mechanism). Therefore, SMEs must clearly establish credit ownership from the outset, avoid selling or announcing credits not registered in the national system, and seek legal or technical consultation when engaging in international transactions to prevent errors and ensure credibility.",

    "question": "How should SME businesses react if ETS regulations change suddenly?",
    "answer": "## Context and Policy Risks within the ETS System[[133]](#footnote-132) [[134]](#footnote-133)\nThe Emissions Trading System (ETS) is an economic instrument adopted by many countries to control greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by issuing emission allowances and allowing businesses to trade surplus or deficit portions in the market. However, because the ETS depends on national policies and international commitments, such as updates to the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) or regulations on border carbon taxes like the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), it can be subject to rapid and unpredictable changes. Examples of such sudden changes include reductions in free allocation of emission allowances, the application of auction-based allocation instead of free allocation, adjustments to MRV reporting regulations, and changes in penalty levels for exceeding allowances. These shifts can cause financial disruption, production interruptions, and reputational damage if businesses are not prepared.\n## Recommended Solutions for SME Businesses\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), due to limited resources, require proactive and flexible strategies to mitigate the impact of ETS changes.\n### Establishing a Department or Hiring Policy Monitoring Consultants\nBusinesses should create an internal team responsible for monitoring and analyzing policies related to the carbon market, particularly legal documents issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, the Ministry of Finance, and international commitments. If internal resources are insufficient, specialized consulting firms can be hired to provide regular updates on ETS, CBAM, and carbon market linkage mechanisms. Timely updates enable businesses to adjust production plans, investments, and reserve carbon credits proactively.\n### Scenario Planning\nSMEs should develop different development scenarios depending on the extent of ETS policy changes, for example:\n* Scenario 1: Maintaining the free allowance quota.\n* Scenario 2: Reducing the allowance quota by 20%.\n* Scenario 3: Mandatory purchase of the entire allowance quota through auctioning.\nEach scenario should include corresponding financial plans, cash flow analysis, credit needs, and low-carbon technology investment strategies. Scenario planning helps businesses avoid being passive in response to policy changes and builds medium-term climate risk management capacity.\n### Developing a flexible strategy combining the ETS market and the voluntary market (VCM)\nBusinesses should not rely solely on ETS-allocated emission quotas but incorporate credits from the voluntary carbon market (VCM). Credits from VCM standards such as VCS (Verra) or Gold Standard can be:\n* Stockpiled as carbon assets to cover potential ETS quota reductions.\n* Used to cope with CBAM obligations when exporting goods to the EU.\n* Sold to generate revenue to offset emission costs.\nThis combined strategy diversifies carbon supply and optimizes compliance costs.\n## Illustrative Example\nA ceramics manufacturing business in Binh Duong emits approximately 15,000 tCO₂ per year. During 2025–2026, it is allocated 13,000 tCO₂ free under Vietnam’s ETS. If by 2027 the government reduces the quota to 9,000 tCO₂, the business faces a deficit of 6,000 tCO₂. If unprepared, it would need to purchase quotas on the exchange at high prices, increasing production costs and losing competitiveness. If prepared, the business could have proactively purchased 6,000 VCS credits at a lower price in advance and used them to cover the deficit, while simultaneously installing a fuel-efficient furnace system, reducing emissions to 12,000 tCO₂/year.",

    "question": "What mechanisms ensure transparency when registering and trading carbon credits?",
    "answer": "## The Importance of Transparency in the Carbon Market\nTransparency is a core factor in ensuring the reliability, effectiveness, and fair operation of the carbon credit market. A transparent carbon market helps prevent fraud, credit manipulation, or the issuance of invalid credits, protects the rights and interests of participating parties (businesses, regulatory agencies, investors), and ensures that emission reductions are real, verifiable, and not double-counted. As Vietnam develops its carbon market according to the roadmap until 2030, numerous mechanisms are being implemented to enhance transparency throughout the entire cycle, from project registration to credit trading.\n## Mechanisms Ensuring Transparency According to Current Regulations in Vietnam\nPursuant to Decree No. 06/2022/ND-CP of the Government of Vietnam on greenhouse gas emission reduction and carbon market development, three main groups of solutions have been established:\n### State-Managed Carbon Credit Exchange\nThe government assigns the Hanoi Stock Exchange (HNX) to organize the national carbon credit exchange, expected to officially operate after 2027. The exchange will act as an intermediary platform where businesses can list eligible carbon credits, execute transactions transparently at market prices, and be supervised by regulatory authorities to protect participants and prevent fraud. Unlike over-the-counter (OTC) voluntary trading, the national exchange helps establish public, fair carbon credit prices and improves accessibility for small enterprises.\n### National Carbon Market Database System\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Environment is developing a nationwide integrated data system to track, manage, and store all information related to carbon projects: from registration, MRV results, credit generation, transfers, to cancellation. The system connects relevant parties, including validation bodies (DOEs), verification organizations, credit issuance bodies, and auditing agencies, allowing for public disclosure of essential project information to ensure social and market oversight. This national database is comparable to systems in Japan, South Korea, and EU ETS countries.\n### Transparent Project Design and Disclosure\nAll projects participating in the carbon market in Vietnam must prepare a Project Design Document (PDD) that includes additionality analysis, baseline emissions forecast, monitoring plans, and risk assessment and mitigation measures. After validation and verification by a third-party DOE, the PDD is partially disclosed on the national management system, helping buyers and the public monitor credit quality.\n## Illustrative Example\nA wood processing enterprise in the Central Highlands implements a biomass energy project that converts agricultural by-products into energy instead of burning them. This project registers to generate carbon credits under the voluntary market but is expected to be listed on the national exchange after 2028. The transparency process works as follows: the PDD is developed according to Ministry’s guidelines and verified by an international organization (e.g., TUV Nord); the project is assigned an identification code and all information is stored in the national data system; when registering to sell 20,000 credits, transaction information such as volume, selling price, and buyer is displayed on the HNX exchange; regulatory authorities can check the transaction history, and buyers can retrieve credit data via a QR code or reference number. This system improves credit reliability, enabling enterprises to attract international partners with strict transparency and traceability requirements.\n##\n## Recommendations for SMEs\nTo participate successfully in Vietnam’s transparent carbon market, SMEs should: familiarize themselves with PDD development, MRV implementation, and standard record keeping; participate in training or cooperate with consulting units to understand regulations for the national data system; proactively research the HNX exchange’s operational mechanism during the preparatory phase (2025-2027); and prioritize verification partners and technologies that enhance credit traceability, such as blockchain or digital auditing tools.\n#",

    "question": "How to demonstrate co-benefits (social, ecosystem) to attract investors?",
    "answer": "## Concept and role of “co-benefits”\nCo-benefits are positive values beyond the emission reduction objective that a carbon project can bring to the local community, society, and ecosystem. These benefits may include creating sustainable employment for local people, conserving biodiversity and increasing forest cover, improving water quality, air quality, or public health, and supporting education, training, or empowerment of vulnerable groups. For investors, especially impact funds, Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), and companies with net-zero strategies, co-benefits are a decisive factor in project selection. The clearer a project demonstrates socio-environmental impact, the higher the likelihood of receiving funding or selling credits at a premium price.\n## Solutions for Demonstrating Co-Benefits in Project Design and Communication\n### Integrating Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into the Project Design Document (PDD)\nBusinesses should clearly identify which SDGs their project contributes to, for example: SDG 13 - Climate Action, SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 8 - Sustainable Work, and SDG 15 - Life on Land. This information should be included in the social and environmental impact analysis section of the PDD, together with an SDG monitoring plan. Using SDG language and indicators helps align the project with international donor expectations and facilitates the project evaluation process.\n### Applying internationally recognized co-benefits measurement frameworks\nTwo leading international standards provide frameworks for assessing and verifying co-benefits:\n* *Gold Standard for the Global Goals (GS4GG):* Integrates SDG assessment using the SDG Impact Tool, allowing quantitative and qualitative measurement of co-benefit indicators.\n* *CCB Standards (Climate, Community, and Biodiversity)[[135]](#footnote-134):* Commonly applied in afforestation, reforestation, and land conservation projects, providing a structured assessment of impacts on indigenous communities and biodiversity.\nBusinesses can utilize these toolkits from project development, register for third-party verification to enhance credibility, and obtain high-standard labeling (e.g., “Gold Standard Certified”) which can increase the market value of credits.\n### Communicating Using Specific, Transparent, and Understandable Indicators\nDemonstrating co-benefits should include specific, measurable indicators to improve persuasiveness. Examples include:\n| Category | Illustrative Indicator |\n| --- | --- |\n| Employment | 150 new jobs for local workers |\n| Environment | Increase forest area by 120 hectares over 5 years |\n| Clean Water | 300 households gaining access to water sources meeting WHO standards |\n| Education | Training 50 farmers on circular farming techniques |\nThese indicators should be periodically updated and included in transparent reports such as annual impact reports, ESG reports, or project marketing materials.\n## Illustrative Example\nA domestic wastewater treatment project in the Mekong Delta reduces methane (CH₄) emissions via biogas technology. Beyond reducing 20,000 tCO₂ per year, it provides co-benefits: contributing to SDG 6 by providing standard-compliant reclaimed water to 500 households; contributing to SDG 13 by reducing 20,000 tCO₂ through gas capture; and contributing to SDG 8 by creating 35 technical and plant operation jobs. The project utilized the Gold Standard SDG Impact Tool for quantification and was verified and validated by an international organization. As a result, a climate fund donor from Switzerland invested capital at preferential interest rates and signed a long-term carbon credit purchase agreement.\n## Recommendations for SMEs\nFrom the conceptual stage, enterprises should identify potential co-benefits based on business models and project location, utilize international assessment frameworks such as Gold Standard or CCB to enhance recognition, proactively communicate and quantify co-benefits to satisfy investors and enhance corporate image, and collaborate with social organizations, NGOs, or universities to objectively monitor and evaluate impact.",

Examples include:\n| Category | Illustrative Indicator |\n| --- | --- |\n| Employment | 150 new jobs for local workers |\n| Environment | Increase forest area by 120 hectares over 5 years |\n| Clean Water | 300 households gaining access to water sources meeting WHO standards |\n| Education | Training 50 farmers on circular farming techniques |\nThese indicators should be periodically updated and included in transparent reports such as annual impact reports, ESG reports, or project marketing materials.\n## Illustrative Example\nA domestic wastewater treatment project in the Mekong Delta reduces methane (CH₄) emissions via biogas technology. Beyond reducing 20,000 tCO₂ per year, it provides co-benefits: contributing to SDG 6 by providing standard-compliant reclaimed water to 500 households; contributing to SDG 13 by reducing 20,000 tCO₂ through gas capture; and contributing to SDG 8 by creating 35 technical and plant operation jobs. The project utilized the Gold Standard SDG Impact Tool for quantification and was verified and validated by an international organization. As a result, a climate fund donor from Switzerland invested capital at preferential interest rates and signed a long-term carbon credit purchase agreement.\n## Recommendations for SMEs\nFrom the conceptual stage, enterprises should identify potential co-benefits based on business models and project location, utilize international assessment frameworks such as Gold Standard or CCB to enhance recognition, proactively communicate and quantify co-benefits to satisfy investors and enhance corporate image, and collaborate with social organizations, NGOs, or universities to objectively monitor and evaluate impact.",

    "question": "What governance principles should SMEs follow to ensure transparency throughout the entire cycle?",
    "answer": "## Recommended Governance Principles for SMEs\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) participating in the carbon market must adopt clear, transparent, and accountable governance mechanisms. This section outlines four key governance principles, applying ESG standards, establishing an independent internal audit system, ensuring transparent record-keeping, and engaging in learning networks, that can help SMEs build credibility and attract investors.\n### Applying the ESG principles (Environmental, Social, Governance)\nESG serves as a comprehensive framework for assessing an organization’s environmental performance (E), social impact (S), and governance capacity (G). In the carbon market context, integrating ESG principles into the project cycle ensures both environmental integrity and social accountability.\nFrom an environmental standpoint, enterprises should honestly report emissions data, develop emission reduction plans, and ensure efficient use of resources. On the social side, businesses must commit to supporting local communities, uphold employee rights, and maintain transparency regarding social impacts. In terms of governance, enterprises should establish internal monitoring procedures, ensure transparency of credit ownership, and develop clear mechanisms for resolving conflicts of interest.\n### Establishing an independent internal audit system\nAn effective internal audit acts as the “second line of defense,” verifying that all data, procedures, and credit transactions comply with regulations and are conducted transparently. SMEs can either establish an internal audit department, if resources permit, or hire an independent third party to perform periodic audits, especially for MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) activities.\nAudits should cover input data (fuel and output), calculation tools, data storage systems, credit transaction ledgers, and all reports submitted to competent authorities. This not only guarantees data accuracy but also strengthens investor confidence in the enterprise’s governance system.\n### Transparent record keeping and disclosure throughout the cycle\nTransparency requires that every step of the carbon credit cycle be recorded and verifiable. During the design phase, enterprises should maintain PDD documentation, additionality analyses, and risk assessments. In the operation phase, they should keep detailed MRV reports, operation logs, and measurement data. In the transaction phase, all credit sales contracts, registry confirmations, and ownership adjustments must be properly archived.\nPublic disclosure of selected information, via company websites, ESG reports, or annual sustainability reports, enhances trust with partners, aligns with international market requirements, and prepares the enterprise for listing its credits on carbon exchanges.\n### Participating in learning and cross-monitoring networks such as the Carbon Market Forum\nEngaging with peer networks such as the Carbon Market Forum, the Vietnam Business Council for Sustainable Development (VBCSD), and the Partnership for Market Implementation (PMI) enables SMEs to update policies, learn best practices from successful projects, and connect with experts, verification bodies, and government agencies.\nParticipation in such networks also establishes a peer-review mechanism that helps detect ethical risks and prevent credit fraud, contributing to a more trustworthy carbon market ecosystem.\n## Illustrative Example\nA notable example is an SME in Dong Nai Province producing non-fired bricks. By replacing cement with fly ash, the company participated in an emission-reduction program that fully integrated ESG principles. In its PDD documentation, the enterprise conducted environmental and social impact assessments and set out clear governance regulations on credit ownership between its parent company and branch.\nQuarterly internal audits were carried out to review the amount of fly ash used, the production process, and operational logs. Emissions data were transparently published on the company’s website and reported to both the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) and Korean investors. Moreover, the enterprise actively participated in the VBCSD network, sharing its experience at a national carbon credit workshop.\nBecause of its commitment to transparency, the enterprise’s project was highly valued by international investors, who purchased its credits at a premium price, 15 percent higher than the market average.",

    "question": "Globally, what models or strategies have small and medium manufacturing enterprises in the steel and cement industries adopted to reduce emissions and participate in the carbon credit market?",
    "answer": "Recently, many small and medium manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) in the steel and cement sectors, which are high-emission industries, have gradually implemented solutions to reduce greenhouse gases and access the carbon credit market. Common measures include: (1) improving energy efficiency, (2) switching to alternative fuels, (3) changing production processes, and (4) investing in emissions reduction technology[[136]](#footnote-135)\nFor example, medium-sized cement enterprises in India have adopted the installation of waste heat recovery systems to utilize surplus heat during the production process. Additionally, they partially replace clinker with industrial additives such as fly ash or blast furnace slag. These solutions both help reduce fuel consumption and cut down the amount of CO₂ generated during the clinker firing process, which is the main source of emissions in the cement industry. Some companies have registered these projects under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol to generate carbon credits. According to a report by the Economic Times, even since 2007, many Indian enterprises have generated a large volume of carbon credits by utilizing fly ash and installing waste heat recovery systems.[[137]](#footnote-136)\nIn the steel industry, SME businesses have modernized furnaces, installed energy-efficient motors, improved production lines, and implemented waste heat recovery for power generation. A medium-sized steel plant in Gujarat state (India) installed a 25 MW power generation unit utilizing waste heat, helping to save electricity derived from coal and reducing nearly 160,000 tons of CO₂ annually, while also receiving certified emission credits.[[138]](#footnote-137)\nIn addition to on-site solutions, many SME businesses are exploring new technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCUS), despite the high cost, to prepare for the long-term transition phase. Some pioneering businesses have participated in demonstration projects or trials of new technologies, and utilized the voluntary carbon credit market to mobilize finance for these initiatives. The Climate Action Reserve organization has developed a specific standard set for low-carbon cement, aiming to encourage businesses to innovate cement types with low clinker content, thereby reducing emissions and earning carbon credits for technological innovation.[[139]](#footnote-138)\nIn the steel industry, new production methods, such as using green hydrogen combined with electric arc furnaces, are gradually emerging. Some international policy proposals allow steel companies to receive carbon credits if they reduce their emission intensity compared to the industry average (based on traditional blast furnace technology).\nIn countries with emission trading systems (ETS) such as the EU, South Korea, or China, some SME businesses in the steel and cement industries have had to participate in the ETS and buy and sell emission allowances, or improve technology to avoid exceeding emission thresholds. Even when not directly regulated, smaller supplier businesses must also reduce emissions to maintain competitiveness within the value chain. Finally, many SMEs also use voluntary carbon credits to offset unavoidable emissions, by investing in afforestation or renewable energy projects, thereby enhancing their “green” image with customers and investors.\nIn summary, through measures such as energy saving, production process innovation, material substitution, and leveraging carbon technology, small and medium-sized enterprises in the global steel and cement industries have begun reducing emissions. By registering these initiatives under standards like CDM, Verra, Gold Standard, or national mechanisms, many businesses have turned emission reductions into actual revenue streams, while gradually integrating into the global carbon credit market, preparing for the future trend of carbon neutrality.",

Some companies have registered these projects under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol to generate carbon credits. According to a report by the Economic Times, even since 2007, many Indian enterprises have generated a large volume of carbon credits by utilizing fly ash and installing waste heat recovery systems.[[137]](#footnote-136)\nIn the steel industry, SME businesses have modernized furnaces, installed energy-efficient motors, improved production lines, and implemented waste heat recovery for power generation. A medium-sized steel plant in Gujarat state (India) installed a 25 MW power generation unit utilizing waste heat, helping to save electricity derived from coal and reducing nearly 160,000 tons of CO₂ annually, while also receiving certified emission credits.[[138]](#footnote-137)\nIn addition to on-site solutions, many SME businesses are exploring new technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCUS), despite the high cost, to prepare for the long-term transition phase. Some pioneering businesses have participated in demonstration projects or trials of new technologies, and utilized the voluntary carbon credit market to mobilize finance for these initiatives. The Climate Action Reserve organization has developed a specific standard set for low-carbon cement, aiming to encourage businesses to innovate cement types with low clinker content, thereby reducing emissions and earning carbon credits for technological innovation.[[139]](#footnote-138)\nIn the steel industry, new production methods, such as using green hydrogen combined with electric arc furnaces, are gradually emerging. Some international policy proposals allow steel companies to receive carbon credits if they reduce their emission intensity compared to the industry average (based on traditional blast furnace technology).\nIn countries with emission trading systems (ETS) such as the EU, South Korea, or China, some SME businesses in the steel and cement industries have had to participate in the ETS and buy and sell emission allowances, or improve technology to avoid exceeding emission thresholds. Even when not directly regulated, smaller supplier businesses must also reduce emissions to maintain competitiveness within the value chain. Finally, many SMEs also use voluntary carbon credits to offset unavoidable emissions, by investing in afforestation or renewable energy projects, thereby enhancing their “green” image with customers and investors.\nIn summary, through measures such as energy saving, production process innovation, material substitution, and leveraging carbon technology, small and medium-sized enterprises in the global steel and cement industries have begun reducing emissions. By registering these initiatives under standards like CDM, Verra, Gold Standard, or national mechanisms, many businesses have turned emission reductions into actual revenue streams, while gradually integrating into the global carbon credit market, preparing for the future trend of carbon neutrality.",

    "answer": "Recently, logistics, distribution, and warehousing businesses globally have been implementing numerous solutions aimed at reducing emissions and participating in the carbon credit market, focusing on (1) operational optimization, (2) vehicle conversion, (3) infrastructure modernization, and (4) utilizing renewable energy.\nAccording to McKinsey, one of the most common strategies is optimizing the transport network: using smart route planning software, optimizing payload capacity, and shifting from road transport to rail or waterways to reduce fuel consumption. For example, a business in the Netherlands reduced CO₂ emissions by over 15% through optimizing its distribution network and utilizing waterborne container transport.[[140]](#footnote-139)\nIn the same report, McKinsey also pointed out that logistics centers can also be improved for energy savings through the installation of LED lights, motion sensors, high-efficiency HVAC systems, and rooftop solar panels. In Germany, a GLS logistics center operates using 100% renewable electricity, helping almost completely to eliminate operational emissions.\nRegarding transportation methods, many businesses have switched to electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, or use alternative fuels such as natural gas (CNG), hydrogen, or biofuel. UPS and DHL have deployed thousands of electric vehicles in major cities while investing in fast-charging infrastructure to support operations. Furthermore, many businesses have purchased carbon credits to offset unavoidable emissions, or invested directly in emission reduction projects within their own supply chains (insetting). For example, DHL funded a reforestation project in South America to both offset carbon and generate internal carbon credits. Additionally, certification programs such as SmartWay (US) or Clean Cargo (global) help logistics businesses transparently report emission data and register improvements as carbon credits. Some companies have commercialized credits generated from their operations in the voluntary market.[[141]](#footnote-140)\nThus, by simultaneously applying operational measures, technology, and carbon finance, small and medium-sized logistics enterprises have increasingly participated actively in the global decarbonization trend.",

    "question": "What cultivation or forest management models have helped international agriculture and forestry enterprises successfully generate carbon credits?",
    "answer": "The cultivation and forest management models that have helped international agriculture and forestry enterprises successfully generate carbon credits are presented systematically and in detail within international projects and standards related to forest carbon credits. These models include: sustainable forest management models, the REDD+ project, afforestation and reforestation models, and agroforestry models.\nThe Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) model is the most common model, focusing on protecting existing natural forests (such as special-use forests and protection forests), enhancing forest productivity and carbon stock, and controlling deforestation and forest degradation. This not only reduces emissions but also increases CO₂ absorption. For example, projects in many countries have implemented sustainable forest management certification, which is internationally recognized with strict measurement standards according to ISO 14065 and IPCC guidelines.[[147]](#footnote-146)\nFurthermore, the REDD+ project (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) is an international mechanism that supports the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, while promoting forest conservation and restoration. The REDD+ project generates carbon credits by calculating the amount of emissions avoided or the increase in carbon stock compared to the baseline. A typical example is the REDD+ project in Hieu commune, Kon Plong district, Kon Tum province, Vietnam. This project has successfully reduced deforestation and forest degradation while improving community livelihoods. The voluntary carbon credit market has purchased credits from the project, demonstrating the success of applying this model.[[148]](#footnote-147)\nFor Afforestation/Reforestation projects, enterprises apply techniques for planting large-timber forests, promoting biodiversity, using native tree species, and post-planting management techniques to increase forest carbon stock. This model effectively helps absorb CO₂ and generates high-value carbon credits in the international market.[[149]](#footnote-148)\nThe Agroforestry model integrates agricultural cultivation with forestry or perennial crops to increase carbon absorption, conserve soil, enhance biodiversity, and increase community income. Agroforestry projects are designed with long-term credit cycles, ensuring the sustainability and stability of the generated carbon credits.\nGenerally, cultivation and forest management models such as SFM, REDD+, afforestation/reforestation, and agroforestry not only play a crucial role in reducing emissions and absorbing CO₂ but also generate high-quality carbon credits recognized in the international market. Applying these models helps agriculture and forestry enterprises not only meet sustainable development goals but also expand opportunities to access climate finance and enhance brand value in the context of a globally prioritized green economy.",

A typical example is the REDD+ project in Hieu commune, Kon Plong district, Kon Tum province, Vietnam. This project has successfully reduced deforestation and forest degradation while improving community livelihoods. The voluntary carbon credit market has purchased credits from the project, demonstrating the success of applying this model.[[148]](#footnote-147)\nFor Afforestation/Reforestation projects, enterprises apply techniques for planting large-timber forests, promoting biodiversity, using native tree species, and post-planting management techniques to increase forest carbon stock. This model effectively helps absorb CO₂ and generates high-value carbon credits in the international market.[[149]](#footnote-148)\nThe Agroforestry model integrates agricultural cultivation with forestry or perennial crops to increase carbon absorption, conserve soil, enhance biodiversity, and increase community income. Agroforestry projects are designed with long-term credit cycles, ensuring the sustainability and stability of the generated carbon credits.\nGenerally, cultivation and forest management models such as SFM, REDD+, afforestation/reforestation, and agroforestry not only play a crucial role in reducing emissions and absorbing CO₂ but also generate high-quality carbon credits recognized in the international market. Applying these models helps agriculture and forestry enterprises not only meet sustainable development goals but also expand opportunities to access climate finance and enhance brand value in the context of a globally prioritized green economy.",

The goal is to reduce transaction costs, simplify the verification process, and achieve sufficient scale to qualify for carbon credit generation.\nA typical example is the Family Forest Carbon Program in the United States, initiated by the American Forest Foundation, which aggregates thousands of small-scale forest owners under a single Improved Forest Management (IFM) project. The program utilizes a simple and standardized MRV model to reduce verification costs and generate carbon credits through the IFM methodology. These credits are traded on the voluntary market, creating a financial stream for small-scale landowners.[[153]](#footnote-152)\nIn Africa, cookstove projects certified by organizations like Gold Standard or Verra are also often implemented under a collective model, where thousands of households in Kenya, Rwanda, or Ghana adopt new technologies that reduce emissions, which are measured under a centralized system.

    "question": "How do international businesses overcome the barrier of lacking internal technical capacity for emissions measurement and reporting?",
    "answer": "The lack of technical capacity for Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) of emissions is a significant barrier for small and medium-sized enterprises participating in the carbon market. However, many international businesses have overcome this issue by hiring external experts, utilizing digital software, or participating in technical assistance programs offered by international organizations.\nA common solution is partnering with professional consulting firms such as South Pole, EcoAct, or technology companies like Watershed, to conduct initial assessments, establish data collection systems, and standardize reporting according to frameworks like the GHG Protocol. Hiring external experts helps businesses avoid large investments in internal personnel while still ensuring the quality of MRV.[[155]](#footnote-154)\nFurthermore, many SMEs utilize MRV software platforms such as Sweep (France), Plan A (Germany), or Persefoni (USA), which allow businesses to input operational data and receive automated emissions reports, along with proposed emission reduction methods tailored to each source. Many of these platforms currently offer low-cost packages specifically for SMEs.[[156]](#footnote-155)\nGovernments in several countries have provided funding for SMEs to participate in technical assistance programs. For example, the Climate Smart Program in Canada offers funding for SMEs to hire emissions assessment experts and conduct internal training. In Singapore, the Enterprise Sustainability Programme funds up to 70% of ESG consulting costs for small businesses. Several non-profit organizations such as Gold Standard, Clean Cooking Alliance, or GIZ (Germany) also have co-funding programs for MRV costs for SMEs in developing countries, helping them implement carbon projects with low initial costs.\nFinally, many SMEs also participate in collective projects to share costs and receive group MRV guidance. Consequently, even lacking internal technical capacity, they can still meet MRV requirements through external support and digitalization technology.\n1. Lien, M. K., Huy, L. Q., Cong, N.

    "content": "Question: How do international businesses overcome the barrier of lacking internal technical capacity for emissions measurement and reporting?\n\nAnswer: The lack of technical capacity for Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) of emissions is a significant barrier for small and medium-sized enterprises participating in the carbon market. However, many international businesses have overcome this issue by hiring external experts, utilizing digital software, or participating in technical assistance programs offered by international organizations.\nA common solution is partnering with professional consulting firms such as South Pole, EcoAct, or technology companies like Watershed, to conduct initial assessments, establish data collection systems, and standardize reporting according to frameworks like the GHG Protocol. Hiring external experts helps businesses avoid large investments in internal personnel while still ensuring the quality of MRV.[[155]](#footnote-154)\nFurthermore, many SMEs utilize MRV software platforms such as Sweep (France), Plan A (Germany), or Persefoni (USA), which allow businesses to input operational data and receive automated emissions reports, along with proposed emission reduction methods tailored to each source. Many of these platforms currently offer low-cost packages specifically for SMEs.[[156]](#footnote-155)\nGovernments in several countries have provided funding for SMEs to participate in technical assistance programs. For example, the Climate Smart Program in Canada offers funding for SMEs to hire emissions assessment experts and conduct internal training. In Singapore, the Enterprise Sustainability Programme funds up to 70% of ESG consulting costs for small businesses. Several non-profit organizations such as Gold Standard, Clean Cooking Alliance, or GIZ (Germany) also have co-funding programs for MRV costs for SMEs in developing countries, helping them implement carbon projects with low initial costs.\nFinally, many SMEs also participate in collective projects to share costs and receive group MRV guidance. Consequently, even lacking internal technical capacity, they can still meet MRV requirements through external support and digitalization technology.\n1. Lien, M. K., Huy, L. Q., Cong, N.

    "searchable_text": "Question: How do international businesses overcome the barrier of lacking internal technical capacity for emissions measurement and reporting?\n\nAnswer: The lack of technical capacity for Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) of emissions is a significant barrier for small and medium-sized enterprises participating in the carbon market. However, many international businesses have overcome this issue by hiring external experts, utilizing digital software, or participating in technical assistance programs offered by international organizations.\nA common solution is partnering with professional consulting firms such as South Pole, EcoAct, or technology companies like Watershed, to conduct initial assessments, establish data collection systems, and standardize reporting according to frameworks like the GHG Protocol. Hiring external experts helps businesses avoid large investments in internal personnel while still ensuring the quality of MRV.[[155]](#footnote-154)\nFurthermore, many SMEs utilize MRV software platforms such as Sweep (France), Plan A (Germany), or Persefoni (USA), which allow businesses to input operational data and receive automated emissions reports, along with proposed emission reduction methods tailored to each source. Many of these platforms currently offer low-cost packages specifically for SMEs.[[156]](#footnote-155)\nGovernments in several countries have provided funding for SMEs to participate in technical assistance programs. For example, the Climate Smart Program in Canada offers funding for SMEs to hire emissions assessment experts and conduct internal training. In Singapore, the Enterprise Sustainability Programme funds up to 70% of ESG consulting costs for small businesses. Several non-profit organizations such as Gold Standard, Clean Cooking Alliance, or GIZ (Germany) also have co-funding programs for MRV costs for SMEs in developing countries, helping them implement carbon projects with low initial costs.\nFinally, many SMEs also participate in collective projects to share costs and receive group MRV guidance. Consequently, even lacking internal technical capacity, they can still meet MRV requirements through external support and digitalization technology.\n1. Lien, M. K., Huy, L. Q., Cong, N.
