      "question": "What is Carbon Trading?",
      "answer": "<p>Carbon trading is a <strong>market-based approach</strong> to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.</p><p>Companies or nations are issued carbon credits, which represent the right to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide. Those who cannot easily reduce their emissions can buy credits from those who can, creating a financial incentive to reduce overall emissions.</p><h4>Key Components:</h4><ul><li><strong>Cap:</strong> A limit set on total emissions</li><li><strong>Trade:</strong> Exchange of emission allowances between participants</li><li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Meeting regulatory requirements</li></ul>",
